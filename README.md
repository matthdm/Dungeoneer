# üïØÔ∏è Dungeoneer

**Dungeoneer** is a 2D isometric dark fantasy game built using Go and the Ebiten engine. Set in a world of crumbling castles, haunted forests, and cursed ruins, the player must navigate procedurally generated dungeons filled with monsters, secrets, and mystery.

This project is a technical and artistic love letter to games like *Diablo*, *Darkest Dungeon*, and *Stardew Valley‚Äôs* dungeon sections ‚Äî with a focus on real-time combat, tile-based navigation, and rich pixel art.
